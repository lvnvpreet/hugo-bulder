### STEP 1: Open Browser Developer Tools
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to the **Console** tab to monitor our logging

### STEP 2: Complete the Wizard (Steps 1-10)

**Step 10 - Summary**: This is where the 400 error used to occur!

### STEP 3: Test Generation (The Critical Moment!)

1. **Review the summary** - ensure all data is shown
2. **Check Browser Console** - you should see our new logging:
   ```
   🔍 Creating project with data: {name: "...", wizardData: {...}}
   ✅ Wizard data is complete
   ✅ Project created: {...}
   ```

3. **Click "Generate Website"** - This should now work!

### STEP 4: Monitor the Generation Process

**In Browser Console, watch for:**
```
🚀 Starting generation process...
🔍 Checking project status...
📊 Generation readiness: {ready: true, ...}
📊 Project status: {isCompleted: true, ...}
🎯 Starting website generation...
✅ Generation started with ID: ...
📊 Generation status: ...
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ **NO 400 Bad Request Error!**
- ✅ Project creation succeeds
- ✅ Project is automatically marked as completed
- ✅ Generation starts successfully
- ✅ Status polling begins
- ✅ Progress updates appear

### STEP 5: Error Scenarios to Test

**Test incomplete wizard data:**
1. Go back to earlier steps and clear required fields
2. Try generation - should see specific error messages

**Test project completion endpoint:**
1. Use browser console: `fetch('/api/projects/PROJECT_ID/complete', {method: 'POST', headers: {...}})`

## 🔍 What to Look For
