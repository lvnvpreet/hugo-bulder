# Hugo Website Builder - Bug Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "400 Bad Request" Error on Project Generation Start

**Problem:**
When a project was created with full wizard data, the backend was not correctly marking the project as completed (`isCompleted: false`), causing generation to fail with a 400 error when attempting to generate a site.

**Solution:**
- Added logic in `ProjectService.createProject()` to check if the provided `wizardData` contains all required fields.
- If wizardData is complete, automatically set `isCompleted: true` when creating the project.
- Implemented a helper method `isWizardDataComplete()` to validate all required fields are present.
- This ensures that when the frontend creates a project with full wizard data, it's automatically marked as ready for generation.

### 2. "Project Limit Reached" Error

**Problem:**
Users were hitting their project limit, preventing them from creating new projects. The system was also not properly tracking the actual number of projects created vs. the limit.

**Solution:**
- Created a script `fix-user-projects.ts` to adjust the project count accurately.
- Increased the project limit for development to 50 (from the default lower value).
- Fixed the counting logic to ensure `projectsUsed` matches the actual count of projects in the database.
- This ensures users can create new projects up to their updated limit.

## Changes Made

1. **ProjectService.ts**:
   - Added code to store `wizardData` when provided during project creation
   - Implemented `isWizardDataComplete()` helper method to check for required fields
   - Set `isCompleted: true` when wizard data is complete

2. **fix-user-projects.ts**:
   - Script to correct project count and increase limits
   - Updates `projectsUsed` to match actual project count
   - Sets project limit to 50 for testing purposes

3. **test-project-generation.ts**:
   - Comprehensive test script that:
     - Creates a project with complete wizard data
     - Verifies the project is marked as completed
     - Initiates generation to confirm the flow works
     - Checks generation status

## Testing

The fix has been verified through:
- Automatic project completion when created with full wizard data
- Successful generation initiation without 400 errors
- Confirmed project limits are correctly applied
- End-to-end testing of project creation â†’ generation flow

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring generation success rates
2. Consider addressing test failures in the backend
3. Review the temporary project limit increase for production deployment
4. Document the wizardData requirements for frontend developers
